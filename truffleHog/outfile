+; max_content_size (integer, optional) - Max size, in bytes, of consumable data
+; If not defined, defaults to 262144
+; If set to 0 there will be no content size limiting
+;
+; If defined, every piece of content larger than the defined size will be
+; trimmed around the found entity term to fit the defined max_content_size. If
+; max_content_size is smaller than a found entity term the data will be trimmed
+; to the size of that entity term.
+;
+; max_content_size: 262144
+
+; max_rate (float, optional) - Maximum number of submits per second allowed
+; If not defined, defaults to: 1.0
+; If set to 0 submits will not be rate-limited.
+;
+; When set, the system will attempt to spread submits over time the best it can
+; introducing dynamic delays between submits to match the max_rate as closely
+; as possible. For example, if the max_rate is set to 4.0 the system will
+; attempt to submit each queued data piece every 0.25 seconds.
+;
+; max_rate: 1.0
+
+; queue_size (integer, optional) - Maximum processing queue length
+; If not defined, defaults to 1000
+; If set to 0 the processing queue will not be limited
+;
+; If defined the queue will start emptying itself when queue_size limit is
+; reached in a first-come, first-discarded fashion. This ensures that the
+; oldest pieces of data that didn't manage to get processed are discarded
+; first.
+;
+; NOTE: If the process queue is not limited and the max_rate is smaller than
+;       the input (process) data flow rate, the queue will grow over time
+;       consuming the working memory along the way. This might result in
+;       resources depletion on long-term running systems.
+;
+; queue_size: 1000
+
+
+; dumpz (section, required) - Contains configuration for the dumpz source
+;
+[wklej]
+
+; cooldown (integer, optional) - sets number of seconds of cooldown between
+;                                calls to Dumpz API
+; If not defined, it defaults to 60.
+;
+; Holds a number of seconds between consecutive contacting Pastebin servers to
+; check for, and download new public pastes.
+;cooldown: 3600
+cooldown: 60
+
+; limit (integer, optional) - sets the (new) pastes retrieval rate
+; If not defined, it defaults to 100.
+;
+; Holds a number of new pastes to be retreived from Dumpz servers in one
+; call. Combined with the `cooldown` value it determines maximum
+; theoretical pastes processing rate.
+limit: 100
+
+; queue_size (integer, optional) - Maximum process queue length
+; If not defined, defaults to 1000
+; If set to 0 the process queue will not be limited
+;
+; If defined the queue will start emptying itself when queue_size limit is
+; reached in a first-come, first-discarded fashion. This ensures that the
+; oldest pieces of data (that didn't manage to get submitted) are discarded
+; first.
+;
+; NOTE: If the process queue is not limited and the queue_size is smaller than
+;       the data flow rate from Pastebin, the queue will grow over time
+;       consuming the working memory along the way. This might result in
+;       resources depletion on long-term running systems.
+;
+; queue_size: 1000
+
+; network (string, optional) - Defines the network name to use for this input
+; If not defined, it defaults to: dumpz
+;
+; If the end destination of data generated by the dumpz input is the
+; Data Input API make sure this field holds value of a valid (and registered)
+; network in the system as otherwise processing will be rejected by DAI.
